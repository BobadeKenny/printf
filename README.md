# printf
printf is the C language function to do formatted printing.
printf takes one argument:
a string of characters to be printed. This string is
composed of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it appears. So printf("xyz"); would simply print an x, then a y, and finally a z. This is not
exactly ‚Äúformatted‚Äù printing, but it is still the basis
of what printf does.

Format Specifications

Every format specification starts with a percent sign
and ends with a letter. The letters are chosen to have
some mnemonic meaning. Here is a partial list:

%c print a single character

%d print a decimal (base 10) number

%e print an exponential floating-point number

%f print a floating-point number

%g print a general-format floating-point number

%i print an integer in base 10

%o print a number in octal (base 8)

%s print a string of characters

%u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number

%x print a number in hexidecimal (base 16)

%% print a percent sign (\% also works)

Requirements

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per fileIn the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don‚Äôt have to push them to your repo (if you do we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don‚Äôt forget to push your header file
